# .github/workflows/thought-leadership.yml
#
# Thought Leadership Generator
# Triggered on a Monday 8:00 AM UTC cron schedule.
# Also supports manual dispatch via workflow_dispatch for testing.
#
# Note: GitHub-hosted cron jobs may run up to 15-30 minutes late during
# high-load periods — this is acceptable for a weekly thought leadership post.
#
# Concurrency: at most one run active at a time per workflow name.
# The group key is "Thought Leadership Generator" — distinct from
# "Blog Post Generator" — so the two workflows cannot cancel each other.
#
# PUBLISH_STATUS defaults to 'draft' if the variable is not set (handled
# in wp-client.js via process.env.PUBLISH_STATUS || 'draft'). Ensure the
# repository variable is set to 'draft' to override any org-level setting.
